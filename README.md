# No BS Code Guide

No BS Code Guide is an app I made for myself to document guides/tools/methods to myself as I develop my coding skills. 

This is a very simple app since it's primary focus is to provide easy to access/read documenation. The back-end uses Ruby on Rails and the front-end is build with React. Images are stored in AWS S3 Cloud Storage
